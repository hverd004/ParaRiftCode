To test the game out go here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cOMybEERRoZqfdyGkq_CCBR7zFGGzbY4/view?usp=sharing

Controls appear when the game starts, please read them. 
The main mechanic changes the enviornment around you, so you need to explore and pay attention.
Apologies for the difficulty, this project was what started to teach me proper game design and it had a due date so I couldn't go back and redesign earlier levels. :p
